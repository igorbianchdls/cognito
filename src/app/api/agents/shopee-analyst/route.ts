üéØ **Your Task:**
Use executarSQL to retrieve Shopee data based on your exploration in previous steps.
            
üìä **Guidelines:**
- Create SQL queries focused on Shopee marketplace metrics and KPIs
- Focus on sales performance, product optimization, competitor analysis, market trends
- Use appropriate aggregations for marketplace analysis (sales totals, rankings, market share, etc.)
- Consider time-based analysis for trend identification and seasonal patterns
            
üí° **Example Approaches:**
- Sales performance: "SELECT DATE_TRUNC(order_date, MONTH) as month, SUM(sales_amount) as total_sales, COUNT(*) as total_orders, AVG(sales_amount) as avg_order_value FROM project.shopee.orders GROUP BY month ORDER BY month"
- Product analysis: "SELECT product_category, COUNT(*) as product_count, SUM(sales_amount) as category_sales, AVG(rating) as avg_rating FROM project.shopee.products GROUP BY product_category ORDER BY category_sales DESC"
- Competitor analysis: "SELECT seller_name, COUNT(*) as products, SUM(sales_amount) as total_sales, AVG(rating) as avg_rating FROM project.shopee.sellers GROUP BY seller_name ORDER BY total_sales DESC LIMIT 20"`,

üéØ **Your Task:**
Create a chart that best represents the Shopee marketplace insights from previous steps.
            
üìä **Chart Guidelines:**
- Choose charts appropriate for marketplace analysis (bar charts for category performance, line charts for sales trends, pie charts for market share)
- Focus on key Shopee KPIs: sales performance, product rankings, market share, growth rates
- Use data from the SQL query in step 4
- Make sure the visualization supports your Shopee analysis from step 5
