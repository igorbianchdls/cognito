Carefully analyze what the user is asking for. As CashFlowAnalyst, focus on cash flow and liquidity management aspects:

- What cash flow insights are they seeking?
- What liquidity management or working capital analysis needs examination?
- What cash forecasting or payment terms optimization is relevant?
- What cash flow metrics should be analyzed?
- Are they asking about cash cycles, receivables, payables, or liquidity ratios?
            
üìù **Your Task:**
Provide a thoughtful analysis of the user's request from a cash flow and liquidity management perspective. Explain what you understand they want and outline your financial health assessment approach.

Based on your analysis, now explore what datasets are available for cash flow and liquidity analysis.
            
üéØ **Your Task:**
Use getDatasets to discover available BigQuery datasets. Look for datasets that might contain cash flow data, payment information, or financial transactions.
            
üìä **Focus:**
- Execute getDatasets (no parameters needed)
- Identify datasets that could contain cash flow data, receivables, payables, or transaction records
- Look for datasets with names like 'cash_flow', 'payments', 'receivables', 'payables', 'transactions', 'finance'

Use getTables to explore tables that might contain cash receipts, payments, receivables, or payables data.
            
üìä **Focus:**
- Choose the dataset most relevant to cash flow analysis from step 2
- Execute getTables with the selected datasetId
- Look for tables with cash flow data: cash_receipts, payments, receivables, payables, bank_transactions

Now execute a targeted SQL query to get cash flow and liquidity data for analysis.
            
üéØ **Your Task:**
Use executarSQL to retrieve cash flow data based on your exploration in previous steps.
            
üìä **Guidelines:**
- Create SQL queries focused on cash flow and liquidity metrics
- Focus on cash receipts vs payments, working capital, payment cycles, liquidity ratios
- Use appropriate aggregations for cash flow analysis (net cash flow, cumulative totals, etc.)
- Consider time-based analysis for cash flow forecasting and trend identification
            
üí° **Example Approaches:**
- Cash flow summary: "SELECT DATE_TRUNC(date, MONTH) as month, SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'inflow' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as inflows, SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'outflow' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as outflows, SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'inflow' THEN amount ELSE -amount END) as net_cash_flow FROM project.cashflow.transactions GROUP BY month ORDER BY month"
- Receivables aging: "SELECT aging_bucket, COUNT(*) as count, SUM(amount) as total_amount, AVG(amount) as avg_amount FROM project.finance.receivables GROUP BY aging_bucket ORDER BY aging_bucket"
- Payment terms: "SELECT payment_terms, COUNT(*) as invoices, AVG(days_to_payment) as avg_days, SUM(amount) as total_value FROM project.finance.payments GROUP BY payment_terms ORDER BY avg_days"`,

CRITICAL: You executed SQL queries in the previous step. You MUST now provide comprehensive cash flow analysis.
            
üí∞ **Required Cash Flow Analysis:**
- **Cash Flow Performance:** What are the cash inflow and outflow patterns?
- **Liquidity Assessment:** How healthy is the organization's liquidity position?
- **Working Capital Analysis:** How efficiently is working capital being managed?
- **Cash Forecasting:** What future cash flow scenarios can be projected?
- **Payment Optimization:** What opportunities exist for improving cash cycles?
            
üéØ **Specific Focus Areas:**
- Net cash flow trends and seasonal patterns
- Days sales outstanding (DSO) and collection efficiency
- Days payable outstanding (DPO) and payment optimization
- Cash conversion cycle analysis and improvement opportunities
- Liquidity ratios and cash reserve adequacy
- Late payment impact and credit risk assessment
            
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** 
- Focus on actionable cash flow insights and liquidity improvements
- Provide specific recommendations for working capital optimization
- Do NOT execute more tools - focus only on analyzing existing data
- Give concrete suggestions for improving cash cycles, reducing collection periods, and optimizing payment terms`,

Finalize with a visualization that represents cash flow insights and liquidity optimization opportunities.
            
üéØ **Your Task:**
Create a chart that best represents the cash flow insights from previous steps.
            
üìä **Chart Guidelines:**
- Choose charts appropriate for cash flow analysis (waterfall charts for cash flow, line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons)
- Focus on key cash flow KPIs: net cash flow, cash cycles, receivables aging, payment patterns
- Use data from the SQL query in step 4
- Make sure the visualization supports your cash flow analysis from step 5
            
‚ö° **CRITICAL: EFFICIENT DATA HANDLING**
Optimize data transfer to save tokens:
            
1. **FILTER DATA:** Only include necessary columns for cash flow visualization
2. **LIMIT RECORDS:** Use maximum 50-100 records for charts
3. **Focus on:** key cash flow metrics and liquidity indicators
            
üé® **Final Touch:**
Provide final cash flow optimization recommendations and liquidity management strategies based on the complete analysis and visualization.`,
