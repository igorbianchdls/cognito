- What financial health or cash flow optimization is relevant?
- What ContaAzul metrics should be analyzed?
- Are they asking about invoicing, receivables, tax obligations, or business performance?

- Choose the dataset most relevant to ContaAzul analysis from step 2

üéØ **Your Task:**
Use executarSQL to retrieve ContaAzul data based on your exploration in previous steps.
            
üìä **Guidelines:**
- Create SQL queries focused on Brazilian accounting and ContaAzul metrics
- Focus on invoicing, receivables, tax compliance, cash flow, customer analysis
- Use appropriate aggregations for accounting analysis (revenue totals, tax calculations, etc.)
- Consider time-based analysis for business performance and compliance tracking
            
üí° **Example Approaches:**
- Invoice analysis: "SELECT DATE_TRUNC(issue_date, MONTH) as month, COUNT(*) as invoice_count, SUM(total_amount) as revenue, AVG(total_amount) as avg_invoice FROM project.conta_azul.invoices GROUP BY month ORDER BY month"
- Customer analysis: "SELECT customer_type, COUNT(*) as customers, SUM(total_purchased) as revenue, AVG(total_purchased) as avg_purchase FROM project.conta_azul.customers GROUP BY customer_type ORDER BY revenue DESC"
- Tax obligations: "SELECT tax_type, SUM(amount_due) as total_due, COUNT(*) as obligations, AVG(amount_due) as avg_obligation FROM project.conta_azul.tax_obligations WHERE status = 'pending' GROUP BY tax_type"`,

üíº **Required ContaAzul Analysis:**
- **Business Performance:** How is the business performing financially through ContaAzul data?
- **Cash Flow Health:** What does the receivables and payment data reveal about cash flow?
- **Tax Compliance:** Are there any tax compliance issues or optimization opportunities?
- **Customer Insights:** What customer behavior patterns emerge from the ContaAzul data?
- **Operational Efficiency:** How efficiently is the business operating based on ERP data?
            
üéØ **Specific Focus Areas:**
- Revenue trends and seasonal patterns from invoice data
- Receivables aging and collection efficiency analysis
- Tax obligation management and compliance status
- Customer segmentation and purchasing behavior
- Supplier payment patterns and cash flow optimization
- Brazilian tax regulations compliance (ICMS, IPI, PIS, COFINS)
            
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:**

Finalize with a visualization that represents ContaAzul insights and Brazilian business optimization opportunities.
            
üéØ **Your Task:**
Create a chart that best represents the ContaAzul and Brazilian business insights from previous steps.
            
üìä **Chart Guidelines:**
- Choose charts appropriate for accounting analysis (line charts for revenue trends, bar charts for tax breakdown, pie charts for customer segments)
- Focus on key ContaAzul KPIs: revenue, receivables, tax obligations, customer metrics, cash flow
- Use data from the SQL query in step 4
- Make sure the visualization supports your ContaAzul analysis from step 5
            
‚ö° **CRITICAL: EFFICIENT DATA HANDLING**
Optimize data transfer to save tokens:
            
1. **FILTER DATA:** Only include necessary columns for ContaAzul visualization
2. **LIMIT RECORDS:** Use maximum 50-100 records for charts
3. **Focus on:** key Brazilian business metrics and ERP indicators
