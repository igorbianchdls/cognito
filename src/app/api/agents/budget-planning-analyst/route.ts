- What budget planning insights are they seeking?
- What financial forecasting or variance analysis needs examination?
- What resource allocation optimization is relevant?
- What budget metrics should be analyzed?
- Are they asking about budget vs actual, forecasting, resource planning, or cost optimization?
            
üìù **Your Task:**
Provide a thoughtful analysis of the user's request from a budget planning and financial forecasting perspective. Explain what you understand they want and outline your strategic planning approach.

Based on your analysis, now explore what datasets are available for budget planning and financial forecasting analysis.
            
üéØ **Your Task:**
Use getDatasets to discover available BigQuery datasets. Look for datasets that might contain budget data, financial planning, or resource allocation information.
            
üìä **Focus:**
- Execute getDatasets (no parameters needed)
- Identify datasets that could contain budget data, financial forecasts, or planning metrics

Use getTables to explore tables that might contain budget allocations, financial forecasts, or resource planning data.
            
üìä **Focus:**
- Choose the dataset most relevant to budget planning from step 2
- Execute getTables with the selected datasetId

Now execute a targeted SQL query to get budget planning and forecasting data for analysis.
            
üéØ **Your Task:**
Use executarSQL to retrieve budget data based on your exploration in previous steps.
            
üìä **Guidelines:**
- Create SQL queries focused on budget planning and forecasting metrics
- Focus on budget vs actual analysis, variance analysis, resource allocation, forecast accuracy
- Use appropriate aggregations for budget analysis (SUM for totals, variance calculations, etc.)
- Consider time-based analysis for budget trend identification and forecast validation
            
üí° **Example Approaches:**
- Budget vs Actual: "SELECT department, budget_amount, actual_amount, (actual_amount - budget_amount) as variance, ((actual_amount - budget_amount) / budget_amount) * 100 as variance_pct FROM project.budget.budget_actual WHERE period = '2024' ORDER BY ABS(variance) DESC"
- Department allocation: "SELECT department, SUM(budget_amount) as total_budget, COUNT(*) as line_items, (SUM(budget_amount) / (SELECT SUM(budget_amount) FROM project.budget.allocations)) * 100 as budget_share FROM project.budget.allocations GROUP BY department ORDER BY total_budget DESC"
- Monthly trends: "SELECT DATE_TRUNC(period, MONTH) as month, SUM(budget_amount), SUM(actual_amount), AVG((actual_amount / budget_amount) * 100) as accuracy FROM project.budget.monthly_data GROUP BY month ORDER BY month"`,

CRITICAL: You executed SQL queries in the previous step. You MUST now provide comprehensive budget planning analysis.
            
üìä **Required Budget Analysis:**
- **Budget Performance:** How does actual spending compare to planned budgets?
- **Variance Analysis:** What are the significant variances and their root causes?
- **Resource Allocation:** How efficiently are resources allocated across departments/projects?
- **Forecast Accuracy:** How accurate are current forecasting models and projections?
- **Budget Optimization:** What opportunities exist for better budget allocation and cost control?
            
üéØ **Specific Focus Areas:**
- Budget variance analysis by department, project, or category
- Seasonal spending patterns and budget timing optimization
- Resource allocation efficiency and reallocation opportunities
- Forecast accuracy assessment and model improvement suggestions
- Cost center performance and budget responsibility analysis
- Strategic budget recommendations for future planning cycles
            
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** 
- Focus on actionable budget planning insights and financial optimization
- Provide specific recommendations for budget allocation and variance management
- Do NOT execute more tools - focus only on analyzing existing data
- Give concrete suggestions for improving forecast accuracy, reducing variances, and optimizing resource allocation`,

üéØ **Your Task:**
Create a chart that best represents the budget planning insights from previous steps.
            
üìä **Chart Guidelines:**
- Choose charts appropriate for budget analysis (waterfall charts for variances, bar charts for allocations, line charts for trends)
- Focus on key budget KPIs: budget vs actual, variances, allocation percentages, forecast accuracy
- Use data from the SQL query in step 4
- Make sure the visualization supports your budget analysis from step 5
            
‚ö° **CRITICAL: EFFICIENT DATA HANDLING**
Optimize data transfer to save tokens:
            
1. **FILTER DATA:** Only include necessary columns for budget visualization
2. **LIMIT RECORDS:** Use maximum 50-100 records for charts
3. **Focus on:** key budget metrics and planning indicators
