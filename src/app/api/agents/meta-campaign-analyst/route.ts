- What Facebook/Instagram ad performance should be examined?
- Are they asking about CPM, CTR, CPC, ROAS, or engagement metrics?

üéØ **Your Task:**
Use executarSQL to retrieve Meta Ads data based on your exploration in previous steps.
            
üìä **Guidelines:**
- Create SQL queries focused on Meta advertising metrics and KPIs
- Focus on campaign performance, audience analysis, creative optimization, ROAS analysis
- Use appropriate aggregations for social media advertising analysis (impressions, reach, clicks, conversions, etc.)
- Consider time-based analysis for campaign trend identification

- Campaign performance: "SELECT campaign_name, SUM(impressions), SUM(reach), SUM(clicks), SUM(spend), AVG(cpm) FROM project.meta_ads.campaigns GROUP BY campaign_name"
- Audience analysis: "SELECT audience_name, SUM(clicks), SUM(impressions), AVG(ctr), SUM(conversions) FROM project.meta_ads.audiences GROUP BY audience_name"

- **Campaign Performance:** Which campaigns drive the best ROAS and engagement rates?
- **Audience Strategy:** What audiences perform best and offer scaling opportunities?
- **Creative Optimization:** Which ad formats and creatives drive the highest CTR and conversions?
- **Budget Allocation:** How should advertising spend be distributed across campaigns and audiences?
- **Platform Performance:** How do Facebook vs Instagram campaigns compare in performance?
            
üéØ **Specific Focus Areas:**
- CPM, CTR, CPC, and ROAS performance analysis
- Audience targeting effectiveness and lookalike performance
- Creative format performance (image, video, carousel, stories)
- Demographic and interest-based audience insights
- Campaign objective optimization (awareness, traffic, conversions)
- Frequency and reach optimization opportunities

üéØ **Your Task:**
Create a chart that best represents the Meta advertising insights from previous steps.
            
üìä **Chart Guidelines:**
- Choose charts appropriate for Meta advertising analysis (bar charts for campaign performance, pie charts for audience distribution, line charts for trends)
- Focus on key Meta Ads KPIs: ROAS, CPM, CTR, engagement rates, reach, frequency
- Use data from the SQL query in step 4
- Make sure the visualization supports your Meta advertising analysis from step 5
            
‚ö° **CRITICAL: EFFICIENT DATA HANDLING**
Optimize data transfer to save tokens:
            
1. **FILTER DATA:** Only include necessary columns for Meta advertising visualization
2. **LIMIT RECORDS:** Use maximum 50-100 records for charts
3. **Focus on:** key social media advertising metrics and performance indicators
