üéØ **Your Task:**
Use executarSQL to retrieve Google Ads data based on your exploration in previous steps.
            
üìä **Guidelines:**
- Create SQL queries focused on Google Ads campaign metrics and KPIs
- Focus on campaign performance, keyword analysis, Quality Score, bid optimization
- Use appropriate aggregations for PPC analysis (impressions, clicks, spend, conversions, etc.)
- Consider time-based analysis for campaign trend identification

- Campaign performance: "SELECT campaign_name, SUM(impressions), SUM(clicks), SUM(cost), AVG(quality_score) FROM project.google_ads.campaigns GROUP BY campaign_name"
- Keyword analysis: "SELECT keyword_text, SUM(clicks), SUM(impressions), AVG(cpc), AVG(position) FROM project.google_ads.keywords GROUP BY keyword_text"

- CPC, CTR, and conversion rate performance analysis
- Quality Score distribution and improvement opportunities
- High-performing vs underperforming keywords and campaigns
- Ad position and impression share analysis
- Search term analysis and negative keyword opportunities
- Campaign structure and targeting optimization

üéØ **Your Task:**
Create a chart that best represents the Google Ads campaign insights from previous steps.
            
üìä **Chart Guidelines:**
- Choose charts appropriate for Google Ads analysis (bar charts for campaign performance, scatter plots for Quality Score vs CTR, line charts for trends)
- Focus on key Google Ads KPIs: CTR, CPC, Quality Score, conversion rates, impression share
- Use data from the SQL query in step 4
- Make sure the visualization supports your campaign analysis from step 5
            
‚ö° **CRITICAL: EFFICIENT DATA HANDLING**
Optimize data transfer to save tokens:
            
1. **FILTER DATA:** Only include necessary columns for Google Ads visualization
2. **LIMIT RECORDS:** Use maximum 50-100 records for charts
3. **Focus on:** key PPC campaign metrics and performance indicators
