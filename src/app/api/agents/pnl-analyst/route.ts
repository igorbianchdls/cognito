Use getDatasets to discover available BigQuery datasets. Look for datasets that might contain financial data, revenue, costs, or P&L information.

üéØ **Your Task:**
Use executarSQL to retrieve financial data based on your exploration in previous steps.
            
üìä **Guidelines:**
- Create SQL queries focused on P&L and financial performance metrics
- Focus on revenue analysis, cost structure, margin calculations, profitability trends
- Use appropriate aggregations for financial analysis (SUM for totals, AVG for margins, etc.)
- Consider time-based analysis for financial trend identification and period comparisons
            
üí° **Example Approaches:**
- Revenue analysis: "SELECT DATE_TRUNC(date, MONTH) as month, SUM(revenue), COUNT(*) as transactions, AVG(revenue) as avg_revenue FROM project.finance.revenue GROUP BY month ORDER BY month"
- Cost structure: "SELECT cost_category, SUM(amount), (SUM(amount) / (SELECT SUM(amount) FROM project.finance.expenses)) * 100 as percentage FROM project.finance.expenses GROUP BY cost_category ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC"
- P&L summary: "SELECT period, SUM(revenue) as total_revenue, SUM(costs) as total_costs, (SUM(revenue) - SUM(costs)) as net_profit, ((SUM(revenue) - SUM(costs)) / SUM(revenue)) * 100 as profit_margin FROM project.finance.pnl GROUP BY period ORDER BY period"`,

üìà **Required Financial Analysis:**
- **Revenue Performance:** What are the revenue trends and growth patterns?
- **Cost Structure Analysis:** Where are the major cost centers and optimization opportunities?
- **Margin Analysis:** What are the gross, operating, and net profit margins?
- **Profitability Assessment:** Which areas drive profitability vs drain resources?
- **Financial Efficiency:** What operational efficiencies can improve financial performance?
            
üéØ **Specific Focus Areas:**
- Revenue growth trends and seasonal patterns
- Cost category analysis and expense optimization opportunities
- Gross margin analysis by product, service, or segment
- Operating leverage and fixed vs variable cost analysis
- Break-even analysis and contribution margin insights
- Cash flow implications and working capital efficiency

üéØ **Your Task:**
Create a chart that best represents the P&L and financial insights from previous steps.
            
üìä **Chart Guidelines:**
- Choose charts appropriate for financial analysis (waterfall charts for P&L, line charts for trends, pie charts for cost breakdown)
- Focus on key financial KPIs: revenue, costs, margins, profit, ROI, growth rates
- Use data from the SQL query in step 4
- Make sure the visualization supports your financial analysis from step 5
            
‚ö° **CRITICAL: EFFICIENT DATA HANDLING**
Optimize data transfer to save tokens:
            
1. **FILTER DATA:** Only include necessary columns for financial visualization
2. **LIMIT RECORDS:** Use maximum 50-100 records for charts
3. **Focus on:** key financial metrics and performance indicators
