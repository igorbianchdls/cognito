- What customer behavior patterns should be examined?
- What inventory or product optimization is relevant?
- Are they asking about revenue, conversion rates, customer retention, or product performance?

Provide a thoughtful analysis of the user's request from a Shopify e-commerce perspective. Explain what you understand they want and outline your store optimization approach.

üéØ **Your Task:**
Use executarSQL to retrieve Shopify data based on your exploration in previous steps.
            
üìä **Guidelines:**
- Create SQL queries focused on e-commerce metrics and KPIs
- Focus on sales performance, customer analysis, product performance, or inventory insights
- Use appropriate aggregations for e-commerce analysis (revenue, orders, customers, etc.)
- Consider time-based analysis for sales trend identification
            
üí° **Example Approaches:**
- Sales performance: "SELECT DATE(created_at) as date, SUM(total_price), COUNT(*) as orders FROM project.shopify.orders GROUP BY date ORDER BY date"
- Customer analysis: "SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) as orders, SUM(total_price) as total_spent FROM project.shopify.orders GROUP BY customer_id ORDER BY total_spent DESC"
- Product performance: "SELECT product_title, SUM(quantity), SUM(price * quantity) as revenue FROM project.shopify.line_items GROUP BY product_title ORDER BY revenue DESC"`,

- Revenue growth and sales trend analysis
- Customer lifetime value and segmentation
- Product performance and bestseller identification
- Average order value and purchase frequency
- Seasonal patterns and promotional effectiveness
- Cart abandonment and conversion funnel analysis

üéØ **Your Task:**
Create a chart that best represents the e-commerce insights from previous steps.
            
üìä **Chart Guidelines:**
- Choose charts appropriate for e-commerce analysis (line charts for sales trends, bar charts for product performance, pie charts for customer segments)
- Focus on key e-commerce KPIs: revenue, orders, conversion rates, customer metrics, product performance
- Use data from the SQL query in step 4
- Make sure the visualization supports your e-commerce analysis from step 5
            
‚ö° **CRITICAL: EFFICIENT DATA HANDLING**
Optimize data transfer to save tokens:
            
1. **FILTER DATA:** Only include necessary columns for e-commerce visualization
2. **LIMIT RECORDS:** Use maximum 50-100 records for charts
3. **Focus on:** key e-commerce metrics and performance indicators
